It's essentially a meeting held jointly by ITA and CTA to discuss about potential collaboration. As such, the meeting is not about presenting papers as usual academic conferences are, but on summarizing previous work and pointing out future directions. The talks could be general without any technical or mathematical details. The meetings might seem dull if you have no background understanding.

It happened at University of Delaware in Newark, DE, a small city 1.5h by train from New York Penn Station. The inn I stayed is 1h walk from Clayton Hall -- the conference center. I had to take a cab every day from my inn to the hall. I once walked back to my inn. I bet I was the only person walking on the street! The scenary is dramatically in contrast to the busy New York City. In spite of this, I managed to find a good Chinese restaurant and got boiled spicy fish delivered to my inn on the
last day -- a rainy day. 

Get back to the meeting. The first person I introduce myself to is Professor Christos Faloutsos, my advisor's advisor. It turns out he is really affable and just like grandpa. We chatted about Hanghang's moving to Arizona and how hot and dry Tempe is. He also introduced me to his postdoc Stephan Guennemann. Over the lunch, he kindly invited me to sit with him. Along the course of the meeting, I found him very active in taking notes while attending talks, discussing with presenters
offline, asking for any related papers. It must be true love for research that drives him to do so even at such senior age. 

I met Professor Jiawei Han for the first time. He is too famous that I only say hi to him without further introducing myself or discussing any academic problem. I was thinking I will do so after I have some significant papers published. 

The session that interested me most is the demo session. Dong Wang's Apollo project, Fangbo Tao's NewsNetExplorer, Xifeng Yan's graph querying system all give me a deep impression. I wish I can have such interesting demos near the end of my PhD study. *End*
